DJ Wild

DJ Wild is a Card Game that consists of a 53 card deck, 52 regular playing deck cards and the Joker.
In DJ Wild any 2 or the Joker is considered a Wild Card, meaning it can be any card that you want it to be even if that card has already been seen.
To play this game on the website we consider the first hand that is drawn and displayed at the top the Designated Player's hand, and then all consequently dealt hands are the Player hands.
The aim of the game is to Tell what hand the DP has and the opposing player has and determine if that player's hand Wins, Loses, or Pushes with the DP.

There are two modes you can select between in the top left:
Random - 100% randomly generated hands from the 53 cards.
Five Wilds - Gurantees that all 5 wild cards show up in the seven hands somewhere

The Hand Order for DJ Wild is as follows

This still isn't finished just a Playable Prototype. Need to Comment the Code and refactor some things since I just did everything with the first solution that came to mind.
